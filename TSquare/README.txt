********************Dependencies**********************

This project assumes that the following python libraries are installed:
1. SciPy	http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.11.0/
2. NumPy	http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.7.0b2/
3. PIL (Python Imaging Library)	http://effbot.org/downloads/#pil

Also python-2.7 is the preferred interpreter.

*******************Running the project*********************

1. The program to be run is "Arvind_Krishnaa_Jagannathan_Project_3.py"
2. Run the project as
	python Arvind_Krishnaa_Jagannathan_Project_3.py
3. The program runs and prints out the answer to each problem.
4. For Problems 7 and 8, empty placeholder directories were kept under the
"Representations" sub-directory.
5. The answers to 7 and 8 would have been printed as None.
6. To print out the answers to problems 7 and 8 (now), replace the empty directories '7' and '8' with the directories (with the same name)
provided in this submission (present in the zip file Problems_7_8.zip).
7. The project needs a little time (a few seconds) to begin since the libraries need to be initialized but the program runs normally after.

******************Project Structure*************************

[submitted earlier]
1. "Arvind_Krishnaa_Jagannathan_Project_3.py" the main executable
2. Representations - directory with the Visual representation of each problem
3. Source Code - the Python code for the analogy solver

[submiting now]
1. Arvind_Krishnaa_Jagannathan_Project_3.pdf - the project report
2. Problems_7_8.zip - corresponding to the representations for problems 7 and 8.


NOTE: Any Warnings in the Console can be ignored. The summary of the results will be printed in the end
